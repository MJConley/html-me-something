        Lackland AFB, Texas
    </h2>
    <p>
        I joined the United States Air Force and attended basic training at Lackland AFB. <br>
        Lackland AFB is located in southern Texas near the city of San Antonio.  I stayed <br>
        longer than most new airforce trainees since I was also attending foreign language school.

        Osan AB, South Korea
    </h2>
        <p>
            One of my assignments was what the airforce calls a remote assignment.  This normally <br>
            means that the facilities and medical care are not up to american standards.  I was stationed <br>
            in a small village about an hour south of the capital Seoul. The assignment is normally for <br>
            a time period between 12 and 15 months if you are single. Most remote assignments do not allow <br>
            you to take your family if you are married.

            Nellis AFB, Nevada
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nellis AFB is located outside Las Vegas, Nevada.  I worked at Nellis a few days a week <br>
            and worked on the Nellis range the other days.  While at work I got the opportunity to <br>
            work on a new aircraft, the F117A Stealth Fighter.  I spent a lot of time enjoying the <br>
            many tourist areas of Las Vegas.

        <h2>
            Ramstein AB, Germany
        </h2>
        <p>
            I got the chance to be stationed at Ramstein AB in Germany.  I love to travel so being <br>
            stationed in Europe was amazing.  We lived in a little town about an hour south of <br>
            Frankfurt Germany.  We were able to travel all around Europe during the three years there.

        <p>
            One of my last assignments was a special duty assignment at Lambert IAP.  The airforce charters<br>
            commericial airplanes to move militrary members and their families to overseas destinations. <br>
            I worked at commercial airports at both St.Louis and Dallas supporting these missions.
